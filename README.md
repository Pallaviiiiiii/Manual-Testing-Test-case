**Manual Testing Projects: Online Payment Portal**


1. I created and executed a set of comprehensive test cases to validate the payment functionality for a customer/agent platform. 

2. This included testing scenarios such as successful payments with service fee deductions, handling invalid merchant accounts, and ensuring proper error messages for insufficient balance and minimum payment requirements.

3. I verified the expected behavior of the system by conducting functional, boundary, and validation tests, documenting all findings using tools like JIRA for bug tracking.

4. This experience enhanced my understanding of the SDLC and strengthened my skills in manual testing and defect reporting.
